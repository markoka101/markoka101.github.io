				<b id="man">
				I am currently eighteen years old studying computer science at UB. While in high school I have learned some Python, C++, and Java.
				I pushed myself to code well inside and outside the classroom. 
				I participated in two different competitions with teams made of four. 
				One competition was an app development bowl held by a local college and tested us on our general knowledge of computer science.

				When I have free time you can find me playing guitar or video games. I’ve been playing guitar for more than ten years with a few bands.
				I also play some violin, piano and drums. I also find myself running as a way to destress. When I travel I also try to take some pictures. 
				The background of this website is a picture I took while I was in Kenya.
