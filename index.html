			<div id="content">
				<b id="man">
				I am currently eighteen years old studying computer science at UB. While in high school I have learned some Python, C++, and Java.
				I pushed myself to code well inside and outside the classroom. 
				I participated in two different competitions with teams made of four. 
				One competition was an app development bowl held by a local college and tested us on our general knowledge of computer science.
